I’m Emmy Walka, an artist and illustrator hailing from Lagos, Nigeria. With a simple and direct
approach to my craft, I strive to captivate audiences with my witty and laconic pieces which inspire
viewers to delve inside the idea of the hidden message, and also form their own narrative as I
believe art is subjective and more powerful when it leaves room for interpretation.
